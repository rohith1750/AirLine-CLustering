This project focuses on analyzing airline customer data to segment customers into distinct clusters based on their satisfaction levels. Using machine learning techniques such as KMeans clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction, the analysis identifies patterns among satisfied and dissatisfied customers. Key insights include examining features like inflight services, travel type, and demographic attributes to determine factors that influence customer satisfaction. The project also implements data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling, to ensure robust clustering results. Visualizations like box plots, histograms, and pie charts further aid in interpreting the data and insights.
